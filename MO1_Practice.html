    <div class="Explain"><p><b>My name is Md Ahoshan Habib Sarker, and I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Information Technology at the <span style="color: red; font-style: italic;">University of Southern Queensland, Australia</span>. This is my first time learning HTML and CSS, and I am really enjoying the process of building and understanding how websites work. I am highly motivated to improve my skills and I believe that with consistent practice and dedication, I will be able to build a strong career in the IT field in the long run.

    Alongside my academic journey, I have had the opportunity to explore three different countries: Australia, Japan, and the United States. Traveling to these countries has allowed me to experience diverse cultures, lifestyles, and ways of thinking. Each country taught me something unique—Australia helped me become more independent, Japan impressed me with its discipline and technology, and the USA exposed me to innovation and global diversity.

    These international experiences have helped me grow personally and professionally by improving my communication skills, adaptability, and open-mindedness. In the future, I aim to combine my technical knowledge with my global experiences to create meaningful and impactful digital solutions.</p></b></div>

I also experienced a balanced lifestyle here, where education, work, and personal life are equally valued. Overall, Australia has shaped my mindset positively and motivated me to work harder towards my future goals in the IT field.</p>
